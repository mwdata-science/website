This Lecture will continue our journey with Supervised Machine Learning, with a focus on classification problems. Two algorithms will be covered, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). The two algorithms will be used to classify phishing emails from a real dataset. We will go through each algorithm step by step and compare results from the two.
