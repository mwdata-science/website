In this session, we will go through practical examples in healthcare data using python and Jupyter notebooks. From Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model building, model selection and saving the best model and use it to predict new data. We will use some statistical and mathematical concepts to choose the best metrics at each point. Also, we will use the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for explainability of our models.
