Linear Regression is one of the fundamental supervised-machine learning algorithms. While it is relatively simple and might not seem fancy enough when compared to other Machine Learning algorithms, it remains widely used across various domains such as Biology, Social Sciences, Finance, and Marketing, among others. It is extremely powerful and can be used to forecast trends or generate insights. Thus, I simply cannot emphasise enough how important it is to know Linear Regression — its working and variants — inside out before moving on to more complicated ML techniques. The simplicity of linear regression model can be attributed to its core assumptions. However, these assumptions introduce bias in the model which leads to overgeneralisation/under-fitting.

In this session, we will discuss the linear regression algorithm, how it works, and how you can best use it in on your machine learning projects. We will also cover the representation and learning algorithms used to create a linear regression model, and how to best prepare your data when modelling using linear regression. During practical session, we will analyse marketing data to provide insights about how expenditure on various types of advertising affects bottom-line revenues.
