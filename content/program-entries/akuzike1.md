In today’s world, there has been rapid growth in recent years in the area of Machine Learning.  Machine learning focuses on building systems with the ability to learn and enhance from experience without being programmed to do so. Algorithms are used to make all of this happen. Machine learning algorithms may fall under: supervised, unsupervised, semisupervised or reinforcement learning. These algorithms are applied in so various ways in everyday life. Applications of these algorithms range from self-driving cars, fraud detection and prevention, automated recommendations on social media and websites, personalized/ customized adverts, face detection and image recognition, DNA sequence analysis, personalized cancer treatments, to virtual personal assistants.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are one popular Machine Learning algorithm. An ANN models the brain in that it consists of simple and highly interconnected processors (neurons) connected by weighted links passing signals. Each neuron receives a number of input signals through its connections. This exercise will involve using an ANN to perform binary classification on Breast Cancer dataset to diagnose whether a tumor is malignant or benign.
