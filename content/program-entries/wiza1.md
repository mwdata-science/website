In this lecture, we will understand some basic concepts of data science: The lecture is a deep-dive into data pipelines from data extraction to destination, where the data is consumed by individuals or downstream systems. We will provide a walkthrough of ETL significance in data science, explore key technologies and see a simple demo. We will also explore data mining in Python by connecting to MySQL and running queries. Finally, we will visualize data with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).
