The growth in the use of technology is evident in all sectors of human activity, i.e. education, business, social life and government. This is due to many factors. Two that are most often quoted are ‘the availability of massive datasets’ and ‘cheap computing power’. Data science aims at applying a scientific approach to extract meaning and insights from data. Machine learning aims at developing algorithms that learn from data. Good data sets are crucial to data science and machine learning, because small, messy and incorrect data can waste time and resources and can lead to models that produce meaningless and biased results. This talk will look into the importance of data sets with case study from the Malawi context. It will overview the tasks needed for developing data sets and it will demonstrate how datasets, data structures and algorithms affect each other.
