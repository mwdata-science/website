This lecturer will aim to systematically help participants to "master" and "recognize" the core concepts in statistics and mathematics which are used at different stages in machine learning and data science projects. Concepts like statistics and probability, descriptive statistics, distributions, hypothesis testing, missing data, clustering, regression, classification, errors, bias, sensitivity and specificity,  linear algebra (optimization) and multivariate calculus will be discussed. We will explore how to connect these concepts and when to use them depending on the problem at hand. We will go through practical examples in healthcare data using python and Jupyter notebooks.  From Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model building, model selection and  saving the best model and use it to predict new data. We will use some statistical and mathematical concepts to choose the best metrics at each point. Also, we will use the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for explainability of our models.
