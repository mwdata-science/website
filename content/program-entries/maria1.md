This lecture will be an introduction to Machine Learning. We will cover the learning problem, different types of learning (e.g., supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning), training and testing, error and noise, and a simple algorithm (e.g., perceptron or k-nn). In the lab we will work on some exercises with MNIST dataset (handwritten digits) and we will implement the simple algorithm presented in the theoretical lecture.
