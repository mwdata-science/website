## Can I participate remotely?

YES! You can buy [a conference package for remote participation](/tickets/), [a streaming supporter ticket](/tickets/), as well as streaming the event for free.

## Should I take a COVID-19 test?

As much as it is a responsible choice, we want to have this event take place in a physical space. The venue is limited to <strike>72</strike> 50 participants.

We encourage that everyone going gets a fresh COVID-19 test, in order to make the space feel comfortable.

Speakers arriving from abroad will almost certainly have to take a test in the airport. Danish participants are highly encouraged to get a test 2-3 days before the event, so that the result can come back before attending.

## What does COVID-19 mean for the organizers?

We will test ourselves before the event. As organizers, a lot of our energy has gone into moving the event and answering each others questions and doubts about organizing this. We are very reliefed to have finally reached a conclusion with both a Plan A and a Plan B.

We hope very much that, *even if you are worried about COVID-19*, you will consider buying [a remote conference package](/tickets/) to help keep Django Denmark strong and join us to ensure great new events in 2021.
