# Program

## Week 1: Python Week of Code

The Python Week of Code happens October 18-22 (Monday-Friday) and will be full days of tutorials, exercises and talks.

The purpose of the event is to provide participants with a basic Python knowledge with a special focus on Data Science.
This is both a great way to be introduced to Python and Data Science in general and an opportunity to prepare if you
have been accepted for Week 2's Data Science Bootcamp (but that's NOT a requirement).

# Who are we?

We are a group of people from Mzuzu University, Copenhagen University and FAIR (Fair Allocation of Infotech Resources) and Python Namibia, joining hands to build a community around Data Science and Python in Malawi. We hope that the event will inspire and build long-lasting bonds and projects for the ones involved.
