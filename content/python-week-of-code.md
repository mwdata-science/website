# Python Week of Code

The Python Week of Code happens October 18-22 (Monday-Friday) and will be full days of tutorials, exercises and talks.

Python Week of Code comprises the first week of Malawi Data Science Bootcamp, a 2-week event all taking place at
Mzuzu University's Learning Center [in Lilongwe](/venue/).

The purpose of the event is to provide participants with a basic Python knowledge with a special focus on Data Science.
This is both a great way to be introduced to Python and Data Science in general and an opportunity to prepare if you
have been accepted for Week 2's Data Science Bootcamp (but that's NOT a requirement).

~~To participate, you must [register here](/registration/)~~
